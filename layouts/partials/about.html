<p itemprop="description">VRIPHYS is one of the well-established international conferences in the field of interactive physics simulation for computer graphics and virtual reality (VR) applications. The workshop provides a platform for both senior and early career researchers to present their latest results and share ideas for potential future research directions. The program includes keynote speakers, talks by industry experts, and a single track papers program. </p>

<p itemprop="description">
Topics of interest for the workshop include: physics-based animation, geometry processing, virtual and augmented reality, motion planning, machine learning and optimization for animation, interfaces for creating and editing animations, perception, autonomous characters, group and crowd behavior, simulation of natural phenomena, haptics, sound interfaces, collision detection, contact handling, and robotics simulation.

<p>
Organized in coordination with the <a href="http://cgvr.cs.uni-bremen.de/">Institute of Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality</a>, Unviersity of Bremen.

<p>
Unfortunately, we have decided to <font color="red" size="+1">cancel</font> VRIPHYS’19. </p>

<p>
We do not believe that we can offer a program that meets the level of quality expected by the physics simulation and computer graphics community due to an unusually low number of paper submissions. </p>

<p>
We would like to thank the authors that did submit papers for their time and effort in preparing their submissions. We also thank the international program committee and the workshop organizers of Eurographics 2019 for their help during preliminary stages of planning the workshop. </p>

<p>
Sincerely, <br/>
Sheldon, Kenny, Fabrice, and Gabriel<br/>
VRIPHYS’19 Workshop Chairs</p>
